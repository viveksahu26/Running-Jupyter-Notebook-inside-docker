❄️ ❄️  The project is integration of different technologies such as Computer Vision and AWS Cloud

Let me introduce with my project first of all. The project all about ML model which on detecting identical faces perform some activities.
The model is trained by providing data of various images. And once it is trained it could easily identify those faces. And after identifying faces it performs some activities..

So, I have trained model by providing mine and one of my friends 100 images. And after training it could identify  trained faces. And once it identifies my face or mine friend faces it perform 3 tasks:-

👉  Sends email to my friend

👉  Sends WhatApps Messgae to my friend

👉  Launch an EC2 instance with 10Gi storage in AWS cloud with the help terraform script.
Launch a EC2 with volume 10Gi attached to it, as the model detect your face

How it works ??
📌 Collecting Dataset(100 images)
📌 Training Model
📌 As the model identifies it performs activities on your choice.

Further Usecase:-
It can be used in college for Attendance. Which will be able to identify students and send mail + whatapps to students respective parents.
